    "\n",
    "Our embedded vectors now enter the Transformer block which is the __heart of the GPT architecture__. The attention mechanism here allows the model to attend to different positions in the input sequence when making predictions. The model learns the importance of each input token (now represented with its embeddings) by calculating attention weights, which reflect the token's relevance to other tokens in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens in a few steps - first we project our embedded vectors into Query, Key, and Value vectors. This can get a little more complex for multi-headed attention as you can see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-3-multi-head-attention-deep-dive-1c1ff1024853) but once we have these matrices, we perform scaled dot-product attention by simply following this formula!\n",
